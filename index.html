<h1>Hey there, I'm Matthew.</h1>
<p>It's great to meet you. From a young age, I've always had a fascination with writing, technology, hospitality and service, and public speaking. Over the years, I've done a number of things and developed a number of interests along the way. When I was younger, I made Roblox YouTube videos on a little channel called Brewer Studios, and now, I spend a great amount of time on the world's stage of social media and learning the ways of creatives in the graphic, user interface, and user experience design, photography, and marketing industries. I've picked up interests in voice acting and radio DJing, and I thoroughly enjoy exploring and capturing the beauty of the world through my photography and writing.</p>
